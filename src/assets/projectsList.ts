      "This page is meant to serve as a home page for my projects, writings, and general information.  I love discussing software and sharing my thoughts on development design and practices - additionally, I am always eager to learn new technologies.  As with most things in software engineering, I think the best way to learn a tool is to build something.  The primary impetus to build this project was to have a central landing page for all of my projects in the future, and also a deep curiousity to try TailwindCSS. All in all, this page was built with React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS.  For more thoughts on my experience with tailwind, that will be my first blog entry.  I also wanted to try using an AI assistant to develop this page, and used CodeiumAI",
